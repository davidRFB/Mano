## Welcome

**MANO** (Spanish for "hand") is an open-source project to build a real-time Colombian Sign Language (LSC) translator using computer vision and large language models.

This blog documents the journey—the wins, the struggles, the learnings, and everything in between.

## The Goal

Create a system that:

1. **Sees** hand gestures through a webcam
2. **Recognizes** Colombian Sign Language letters
3. **Corrects** sequences into meaningful Spanish words using LLMs
4. **Runs** in real-time for practical communication

## Current Status

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Data Collection | ✅ 1,871 images captured |
| CV Model | ⚠️ Overfitting (needs better data) |
| Inference Pipeline | ✅ Working |
| LLM Integration | 🔜 Planned |
| Web Interface | 🔜 Planned |

## Tech Stack

- **Computer Vision**: PyTorch, MediaPipe, MobileNetV2
- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, DVC
- **LLM**: Claude/GPT (planned)
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Docker, Cloud Run (planned)
