## The Problem

Communication barriers affect millions of deaf and hard-of-hearing people worldwide. In Colombia, the deaf community uses **Lengua de Señas Colombiana (LSC)** - Colombian Sign Language. While there are interpreters and learning resources, real-time translation technology is still limited.

## The Vision

Build an open-source tool that:

1. Uses a simple webcam to capture hand gestures
2. Recognizes LSC alphabet letters in real-time
3. Uses LLMs to correct letter sequences into meaningful words
4. Runs fast enough for actual conversations

## Initial Setup

### Data Collection

I built a simple capture tool using MediaPipe for hand detection:

```python
# Key features of capture_data.py
- Press any letter (a-z) to capture that gesture
- MediaPipe detects and tracks 21 hand landmarks
- Auto-crops to hand region with padding
- Only saves when hand is detected
```

First capture session: **1,871 images** across all 26 letters.

### Model Choice

Started with **MobileNetV2** because:

- Pretrained on ImageNet (transfer learning)
- Lightweight enough for real-time inference
- Good accuracy on similar gesture recognition tasks

### Experiment Tracking

Set up **MLflow** to track:

- Training hyperparameters
- Metrics per epoch
- Model checkpoints

## What's Next

The first model achieved 100% test accuracy... which is suspicious. Next post will dive into why that's actually a problem and what we found.
