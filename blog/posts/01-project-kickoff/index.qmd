## Objective

Establish a baseline gesture recognition system for the 26 LSC alphabet letters using transfer learning.

## Data Collection

### Method

Built a capture tool using MediaPipe for hand detection:

- Press a letter key (a-z) to capture that gesture
- MediaPipe detects 21 hand landmarks
- Auto-crop to hand region with padding
- Save only when hand is detected

### Dataset Statistics (V1)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total images | 1,871 |
| Classes | 26 (a-z) |
| Min per class | 46 |
| Max per class | 129 |
| Image size | 224×224 |

The dataset shows moderate class imbalance with a 2.8× ratio between the most and least represented classes.

## Model Selection

Selected **MobileNetV2** for the baseline:

- Pretrained on ImageNet (transfer learning)
- 3.4M parameters (suitable for real-time inference)
- Proven performance on similar gesture recognition tasks

### Training Configuration

```python
model = mobilenet_v2(pretrained=True)
model.classifier[1] = nn.Linear(1280, 26)

optimizer = AdamW(lr=1e-3, weight_decay=1e-4)
scheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(T_max=30)
batch_size = 32
epochs = 30
```

## Results

### Training Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Final Train Accuracy | 100% |
| Final Val Accuracy | 100% |
| Test Accuracy | 100% |
| Early Stopping Epoch | 10 |

### Observations

1. **Rapid convergence**: Model reached 100% validation accuracy by epoch 10
2. **No generalization gap**: Train and val curves overlap perfectly
3. **Perfect test accuracy**: All test samples classified correctly

## Issues Identified

The results are suspiciously good. Potential problems:

1. **Near-duplicate images**: Capture rate was ~12 images/second, creating highly correlated samples
2. **Random split leakage**: Near-duplicates likely present in all splits (train/val/test)
3. **Limited variation**: Single capture session, same background, lighting

## Next Steps

- Analyze image similarity between consecutive captures
- Implement temporal splitting to prevent leakage
- Expand dataset with more diverse conditions

---

**Conclusion**: The baseline achieves perfect accuracy on the test set, but this is likely due to data leakage rather than genuine generalization. Further investigation needed.
